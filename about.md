**Great Features**

- Hive is lightweight and efficient NoSQL database solution for Flutter with fast key-value database
  written in pure Dart.
- It is strongly encrypted using AES-256.
- Hive is known for its exceptional performance.
- It's designed for local data storage on the device for storing data without network connectivity
  requirements.
- Hive supports storing various data types directly without requiring complex data conversion. This
  includes primitives, lists, maps, and user-defined models.
- Hive supports type safety, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved with proper types,
  preventing issues related to data type mismatches.
- Hive doesn't require Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools.
- Hive uses efficient serialization and deserialization methods.
- Data is organized within Hive Boxes, similar to collections.

**Problems from Videos**

- **Question**: How to find this database in my mobile device in file manager?<br/>
  **Answer**: Go to file manager and under your app package name.
- **Question**: Why Hive and why not something else like shared_preference or sqlite?<br/>
  **Answer**: Hive is significantly faster, than shared preferences, and sqlite is for different use
  cases as sqlite is for relational databases, in cases where you need to do simple things and you
  don't need queries to search for info Hive makes more sense.
- **Question**: I am making a wallpaper app linked to firebase.. I wanted to know, how can I serve
  the user with wallpapers related to a specific keyword? Like for eg. if a user searches for
  Lamborghini, he should get wallpapers of only Lamborghini and not other cars and wallpapers<br/>
  **Answer**: add keywords field in the database, and from search field search the keywords field in
  database
- **Question**: Does it support windows? And can I back up my data and load it on another
  platform?<br/>
  **Answer**: yes it support windows ‚ö° and if you want to back up your data, you will have to save
  them in a server and get them from the other device and it should work fine
- **Question**: sir can you tell me difference between 1 and 2:

1. ```dart
   Directory directory = await pathProvider.getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
   Hive.init(directory.path);
   ```

2. ```dart
   await Hive.initFlutter();
   ```

**Answer**: Both are the same. The first one can be user without Flutter and the second is made for
Flutter. The second one will handle the directory behind the scene for you üëè Hope this help ‚ö°Ô∏è.

- **Question**: Is there an actual way to connect hive with other forms of cloud databases like for
  example firestore or even MySQL, or do I have to implement them separately?<br/>
  **Answer**: Hive sits in the app itself, mysql is in the server side. So they are different ideas.
  There's not direct connection.

- **Question**: Is hive able to handle millions of Objects, is there a limit?<br/>
  **Answer**: Follow this
  link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64020930/can-hive-in-flutter-store-bigdatasome-gb-files

- **Question**: Now, can anyone comment why store data locally if you can use the cloud?<br/>
  **Answer**: There are multiple scenarios
    - In case internet is not connected and still you wanna show some data
    - Loading from local is way faster then loading from cloud so in case there is some repetition
      of loading data you can store it locally
    - In case you just want to make a application with no need of cloud other than storing data. You
      can use local DB and many more
