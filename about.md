**Problems from Videos**

- **Question**: How to find this database in my mobile device in file manager?<br/>
  **Answer**: Go to file manager and under your app package name.
- **Question**: Why Hive and why not something else like shared_preference or sqlite?<br/>
  **Answer**: Hive is significantly faster, than shared preferences, and sqlite is for different use
  cases as sqlite is for relational databases, in cases where you need to do simple things and you
  don't need queries to search for info Hive makes more sense.
- **Question**: I am making a wallpaper app linked to firebase.. I wanted to know, how can I serve
  the user with wallpapers related to a specific keyword? Like for eg. if a user searches for
  Lamborghini, he should get wallpapers of only Lamborghini and not other cars and wallpapers<br/>
  **Answer**: add keywords field in the database, and from search field search the keywords field in
  database
